## Learning objectives:

Here is a list of concepts that students need to learn in order to accomplish the objective:

- Declaring functions
- Function expressions
- Calling functions
- Declaring variables / Function scope
- Callbacks ** This is the most difficult concept for most students **
- Objects
- Dot notation / bracket notation

These concepts are explained with plenty of examples in the following pages:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON

Here is a live-code session demonstrating most aspects of Objects/Dot notation:

My approach to teach these concepts is to live-code basic examples as I explain.
